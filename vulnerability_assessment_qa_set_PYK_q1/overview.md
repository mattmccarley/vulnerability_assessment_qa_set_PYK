# Question 1

## Prompt
```
Describe the purpose and function of access control lists (ACLs) in operating system security.
```

## Answers

- Purpose: ACLs are used to define and enforce fine-grained access permissions for resources in an operating system.
- Function: ACLs specify which users or system processes are granted or denied access to specific objects or resources.
- Implementation: ACLs consist of entries that define permissions (read, write, execute) for individual users or groups.
- Security Enhancement: ACLs provide more detailed control over resource access compared to traditional Unix-style permissions, allowing for better security customization.
